# Problem 1. "How does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch (across all sample years)?"

1) 
Biological:
Null Hypothesis: Fish length does not predict fish weight for trout perch.

Alternative Hypothesis: Fish length does predict fish weight for trout perch. 

Mathematical:
Null hypothesis: β_1 = 0

Alternative hypothesis: β_1 ≠ 0

2) 

```{r}
fish_data <- read_csv(here("data", "ntl6_v12.csv"))
```

```{r}
fish_data_filtered <- fish_data %>% 
  filter(spname == "TROUTPERCH")
```
