# ENVS-193DS_homework-04_berron-bianca

Introduction:
This is the GitHub repo for Homework #4 for ENVS 193DS. Within this repo are data that tracked fish assemblages of eleven lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, Trout, bog lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog] and 12-15 [Trout Bog], Mendota, Monona, Wingra and Fish) in a study called "North Temperate Lakes LTER: Fish Lengths and Weights 1981-current." 

Methodology:
Within this data set are several variables including lake name, year sample date, gear type, species common name, sample type, depth at which sample was taken, replicate number, individual id, length of fish individual, weight of individual fish, sex, fish part, species sequence and data flag for the fish. Using the EDI portal link that was used to download this data, one can find the methodological and data-specific information about the study [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-ntl.6.34). This data is shareable and accessible by anyone and can also be found using the following citation:

In addition, this repo is public and can be viewed and shared by anyone as well. 

Purpose:
The purpose of this repo is to determine how fish length predicts fish weight for trout perch across all sample years. This was accomplished using linear regression, ANOVA tables, and prediction plots.
